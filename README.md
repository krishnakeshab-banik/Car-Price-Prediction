# Car Price Prediction

This project entails developing a machine learning model to predict the selling price of cars based on multiple features. It covers the entire machine learning workflow—from data collection to model evaluation—using a Random Forest Regressor.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Dataset Details:**  
  The dataset includes features such as:
  - Car name
  - Year of manufacturing
  - Selling price
  - Present price
  - Kilometers driven
  - Fuel type
  - Seller type
  - Transmission type
  - Number of owners

### 2. Data Extraction
- **Dataset Extraction:**  
  - The dataset is provided as a ZIP file.
  - The main CSV file, `car data.csv`, is extracted and copied to a local directory for analysis.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Cleaning Process:**
  - **Missing Value Analysis:** Analyzing missing values and data types.
  - **Column Reduction:** Deleting irrelevant columns to reduce noise in the dataset.
- **Categorical Data Transformation:**  
  - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables such as:
    - Fuel type
    - Seller type
    - Transmission type  
  This transformation converts the categorical data into a numerical format suitable for model training.
- **Data Splitting:**  
  - The cleaned dataset is divided into:
    - **80% Training Set**
    - **20% Testing Set**

### 4. Model Training
- **Chosen Model:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Training Process:**  
  - The model is trained on the training dataset to learn the relationship between the input features and the selling price.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  The model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset using:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R-squared (R²)**
- **Purpose:**  
  These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.

## Explanation of Each Section
- **Data Collection:** Details the source and contents of the dataset.
- **Data Extraction:** Explains how the dataset is extracted from a ZIP file and loaded for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Describes the cleaning process and the transformation of categorical variables.
- **Data Splitting:** Outlines the division of data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training:** Covers the implementation and training of the Random Forest Regressor.
- **Model Evaluation:** Lists the metrics used to assess the model's performance.

## Modules to be Installed
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

Install the required modules using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishnakeshab-banik/car-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

3. **Install Required Modules:**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
